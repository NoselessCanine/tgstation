changes:
  - balance: "Ethereal hunger rate has been adjusted to be 1/8th of its previous rate, now taking roughly 16-17~ minutes to go down from full to normal or normal to none. Ethereal defines have been standardized to help keep this sane."
  - refactor: "Ethereal APC and power store draining/charging methods have been refactored. Please report any issues."
  - bugfix: "Ethereal APC and power store draining/charging no longer arbitrarily caps out at slightly below or above the max/min."
  - bugfix: "Ethereal APC draining/charging no longer runtimes when there is no cell or it gets removed mid-charge."
  - bugfix: "Ethereals can no longer continue charging their stomach even if it gets surgically removed from them mid-charge."
  - bugfix: "Ethereal power store draining actually updated the charge level overlay."
  - qol: "Ethereal APC and power store draining displays a balloon alert when it can't continue for whatever reason."
